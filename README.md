# Learning-C
Series of small projects completed in C to help learn the language (University course).

**invest.c:**
Calculates annual investment returns given initial investment, interest rate, additional contributions, time length (years). Prints results in formatted table.
Learned about operations, loops, output.

**lettercounter.c:**
Takes text for analysis as input. Calculates total occurrences of each letter, percentage of occurrence in terms of the whole text, most and least frequent letters.
Prints all calculated information in a formatted table. Learned about strings, input, loops, arrays, output.

**sort.c:**
Takes input for array and size of array, sorts array, prints unsorted and sorted array. Learned about dynamic memory allocation.

**geopos.c:**
Takes geographic coordinates as input, stores as geoPos objects, sorts and prints by northern most coordinates.
Learned about defining structs, creating new types and working with these new types.

**list.c:**
Created functions to work with linked lists. Learned about linked lists, pointers.

**bst.c:**
Library of functions for working with binary search trees. Learned about binary search trees, new types, pointers.

**math.zip:**
Using files as input to c programs, testing programs by comparing program results to text files containing expected output. Created a makefile to help with testing.

**performance-testing.zip:**
Utilizes dotprod.c to test two functions which calculate dot product of a vector in R3. Functions differ by methodology used, one is clearly more efficient
as it doesn't use a length variable or loop avoiding any unnecessary overhead in the function. performance results can be seen in performance.txt.
Learned about performance testing.

**course.zip:**
Library for working with courses and students. Learned about Doxygen documentation.
